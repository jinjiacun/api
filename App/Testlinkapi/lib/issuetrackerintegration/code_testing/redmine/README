These files that can be complete or incomplete examples
are provided in order to allow you to play a little bit
with TestLink - Redmine integration.
I hope this can be useful for you if you got some error or
doubts during integration, before you run to the web 
searching/asking for help.

Please try to contribute to improve these examples and 
documentation.

I use bitnami redmine installer to create a redmine env.
Using curl and/or postman to run XML examples files 
can be a very good approach (IMHO).
